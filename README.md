Traffic sign detection using ACF(Aggregated Channel Feature) with boosted decision tree.

We recognize detected traffic sign using HOG(Histogram oriented gradient) and SVM(Support vector machine).

This program can detect and recognize speed limit traffic signs in real time(35 fps).

To test this program,

first, put test images in img folder with jpg format

second, make out folder to save result,

finally just execute 'Road_Sign.exe'.
